# Talks & Lectures
This repo contains the list of talks & lectures I've given. Over time, I plan to add others from the past, as I remember & find them.

List (latest first):
* 2024-03-14 [Talk - Engineering in the AI era](2024-03-14-engineering-in-the-ai-era.pptx) - I shared with the engineers at [Groww](https://groww.in/) an opinionated take on what Engineering is about, its relevance in the AI era, and what capabilities engineers should continue to refine for themselves.
* 2024-03-02 [Lecture - Inside the GPU](lecture-series-hwsw/lecture-2-inside-the-gpu) - here we explore GPU architecture & programming models for GPUs. We explore what makes a GPU distinct from a CPU at a hardware level, is it even different at all, and why they excel in areas where they do. During this process, we try to imagine GPU programming models should be like, and in what ways our imagination vs reality agree & disagree. Throughout all of this, we use WebGPU as a way to explore the software API side of things.
* 2024-02-24 [Lecture - Inside the Machine](lecture-series-hwsw/lecture-1-inside-the-machine) - this lecture covers basic computer architecture, designed to bring out principles that are useful in hardware & software, with a little seasoning of details.
