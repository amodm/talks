# Talks & Lectures
This repo contains the list of talks & lectures I've given. Over time, I plan to add others from the past, as I remember & find them.

List (latest first):
* 2024-02-24 [Lecture - Inside the Machine](lecture-series-hwsw/lecture-1-inside-the-machine) - this lecture covers basic computer architecture, designed to bring out principles that are useful in hardware & software, with a little seasoning of details.
