# Lecture Series - Hardware/Software
This is a series of 4 lectures I've created for SST (Scaler School of Technology), that brings attention to how hardware functions underneath all the software we write.

## Design
The series is designed to give a breadth first view, with only minor seasoning of details. It's not designed as a full curriculum, but as an entry point which students can use to then figure out which areas to explore further.

Each lecture has a set of pre-reads that act as a primer, allowing students to enter the class with curiosity and at least some basic knowledge of the facts. The pre-reads are not designed to be _test oriented_, so students should approach it without prejudice. Entering the class without the pre-reads will hurt the student's ability to fully absorb the class.

Each lecture also has a set of assignments, designed to explore some of the concepts at their own time, and in their own way. Most assignments would be useful to do in a group based setting. The assignments should be explored not as a _test_, but as _thinking material_.

## List of lectures
* 2024-02-24 [Inside the Machine](lecture-1-inside-the-machine) - this lecture covers basic computer architecture, designed to bring out principles that are useful in hardware & software. In terms of hardware, we cover CPU, Memory, PCIe, Storage. In terms of concepts, we cover Amdahl's Law, Latency, and how Throughput can be used to hide latency.
